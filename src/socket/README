Server is for scheduler receiving messages and sending command to a Client. 
Client is for worker sending messages to and receiving commands from a Server.

The message falls into two catergories, RESULT and REQUEST. 
The flag of a RESULT message is 0, and 1 for a REQUEST message.

A RESULT message is either a counter example or an intermediate result. 
The format of a RESULT message is as follows:
  RESULTFLAG:MatrixSize:CliqueCount:Matrix
By convention, a RESULTFLAG is 0.
For example,message of an intermediate result with 109 nodes, 56 clique count would be as follows:
  0:109:56:010010001001...

A REQUEST message contains only the request flag. 
  REQUESTFLAG
By convention, a REQUESTFLAG is 1.
