# ramseysearch
This project aims to find as many valid graphs as possible for the "Party Problem" in R(7,7), from the Ramsey Theory set.

A cloud-based search/optimization system that attempts to improve the known bounds on the seventh symmetric
Ramsey Number R(7,7). The search basically consists of finding counter example graphs for R(7,7).

The goal is to find the largest set of non-isomorphic counter example graphs each having the largest node count.
